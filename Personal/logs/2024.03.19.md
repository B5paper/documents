* 如果已经处理过某一天的 task 列表，那么应该标记下已经处理过

	这里的处理包括：处理过 feedback，同步过任务进度

	如果一个 task 列表被标记为处理过，那么它就只剩下一个记录的作用了。一周总结一次，如果没什么用就可以删了。

* 查看 git repo 是超前还是落后

	* `git status -sb`

		执行之前先执行`git fetch`

	* 方法二：

		1. Do a fetch: git fetch.
		2. Get how many commits current branch is behind: behind_count = $(git rev-list --count HEAD..@{u}).
		3. Get how many commits current branch is ahead: ahead_count = $(git rev-list --count @{u}..HEAD). (It assumes that where you fetch from is where you push to, see push.default configuration option).
		4. If both behind_count and ahead_count are 0, then current branch is up to date.
		5. If behind_count is 0 and ahead_count is greater than 0, then current branch is ahead.
		6. If behind_count is greater than 0 and ahead_count is 0, then current branch is behind.
		7. If both behind_count and ahead_count are greater than 0, then current branch is diverged.

		Explanation:

    	* `git rev-list` list all commits of giving commits range. --count option output how many commits would have been listed, and suppress all other output.
    	* `HEAD` names current branch.
    	* `@{u}` refers to the local upstream of current branch (configured with branch.<name>.remote and branch.<name>.merge). There is also @{push}, it is usually points to the same as @{u}.
    	* `<rev1>..<rev2>` specifies commits range that include commits that are reachable from but exclude those that are reachable from . When either or is omitted, it defaults to HEAD.

	* 方法三

		You can do this with a combination of git merge-base and git rev-parse. If git merge-base <branch> <remote branch> returns the same as git rev-parse <remote branch>, then your local branch is ahead. If it returns the same as git rev-parse <branch>, then your local branch is behind. If merge-base returns a different answer than either rev-parse, then the branches have diverged and you'll need to do a merge.

		It would be best to do a git fetch before checking the branches, though, otherwise your determination of whether or not you need to pull will be out of date. You'll also want to verify that each branch you check has a remote tracking branch. You can use git for-each-ref --format='%(upstream:short)' refs/heads/<branch> to do that. That command will return the remote tracking branch of <branch> or the empty string if it doesn't have one. Somewhere on SO there's a different version which will return an error if the branch doesn't haven't a remote tracking branch, which may be more useful for your purpose.

* compiler 终结符，非终结符，与推导

	凡是写成$\text{left} \rightarrow \text{right}$的，都可以将左边的符号用右边替换。

	终结符（terminal）：指 id, print, num, `.`, `+`, `()`, `:=`, `;`

	终结符对应到具体单词或者运算符

	非终结符（nonterminal）：指`S`，`E`，`L`这些

	非终结符是为了分析使用的，创造的抽象符号。

* opencl read image 提供了各种内置函数，可以将图片读取成浮点数形式，还可以读取成整数形式

	可以以整数坐标获取像素值，还可以以浮点数坐标获取像素值。
